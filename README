You'll need to edit scan.pl and change lines for:
use lib "/home/rjd/silicon_dust/development";
set path to the directory where you place dist.pm
$CONFIG_PROG set to path to hdhomerun_config
$TUNER_ID set to your tuner's ID or FFFFFFFF as appropriate
$TUNER to the tuner on your SiliconDust that you want to scan
$TUNER_LAT and $TUNER_LON to your location latitude and longitude.
$WEGT to the path to wget.  Hopefully the options will be the same.
$CACHE_FILE to some file.  I think the file has to exist so touch it before
running scan.pl
$CRICKET_RAW_DIR to a directory you'll need to create first.  Files are
created here by scan.pl
$CRICKET_CONFIG to the config directory where cricket was installed.
$LAST_SEEN_DIR to a directory you'll need to create first.  Files are
created here by scan.pl
$JS_DATA change path to for map_data.js to where it will be served up by apache
change line with cricket-compile to your path to cricket-compile

optional for scan.pl:
change $this_scan_file to a directory where all the output from hdhomerun_config
will be placed.  Uncomment any line with SCAN_FILE (open, print, close). This
may be useful for debugging.  The two units I have had slightly different
output form the SCANNING lines so I had to change the regexp line for it so
that VHF channels would be caught.

Other files:
Place Defaults file in $CRICKET_CONFIG and edit Defaults file
lines starting with ds-source.  Change file paths to what $CRICKET_RAW_DIR
is set to

cp TV/* to the same path as used in $JS_DATA

edit index.html:
Change <title> to what's you'd like
Change google.com key
Change <h1> TV stations received at.. to what you'd like
Change <img src= line to your URL for the *_dot.png files
Change cricket URL to your cricket URL
